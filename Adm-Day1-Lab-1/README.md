## 4. Unattended installation

* Use “--help” to display all options


* Copy, modify (marked parts) and execute:  

> /home/axway/Desktop/APIGateway_7.7.<releasedate>_Install_linux-x86-64_BN<buildnumber>.run --mode unattended --enable-components nodemanager,cassandra,apigateway,qstart,apimgmt,policystudio,configurationstudio --disable-components packagedeploytools,analytics --setup_type advanced --licenseFilePath /home/axway/Desktop/ReadyTech/Inbox/API_7.7_Temp.lic --apimgmtLicenseFilePath /home/axway/Desktop/ReadyTech/Inbox/API_7.7_Temp.lic --prefix /home/axway/install/quickstart --cassandraInstalldir /home/axway/install/quickstart --cassandraJDK /home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/platform/jre --acceptGeneralConditions yes


**Example with 7.7.20240830:**

```
/home/axway/Desktop/APIGateway_7.7.20240830_Install_linux-x86-64_BN04.run --mode unattended --enable-components nodemanager,cassandra,apigateway,qstart,apimgmt,policystudio,configurationstudio --disable-components packagedeploytools,analytics --setup_type advanced --licenseFilePath /home/axway/demo/data/licenses/classic/multiple.lic --apimgmtLicenseFilePath /home/axway/demo/data/licenses/classic/multiple.lic --prefix /home/axway/install/quickstart --cassandraInstalldir /home/axway/install/quickstart --cassandraJDK /home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/platform/jre --acceptGeneralConditions yes
```


** Installation takes a few mintues to complete. After issuing the command, there will be no output for a few mintues. 

*Important to remember*

* Do not forget about patches
* Installation only finished once validated (see later)
* If QuickStart is installed, processes started
* Be careful of patches

What you must see as a result of installation?

* In installation folder
    * Log file (troubleshooting)
    * apigateway
    * cassandra
    * configurationstudio
    * policystudio
    * uninstall

* Process started (due to QuickStart)
    * ANM
    * Instance
    * Cassandra

### 4.1. Wait, this is not production installation!

* QuickStart simplifies creation of development environment and should not be used for production

* Some other modules are needed before, especially
    * Topology
    * Deployment
    * Cassandra

### 4.2. How do I do API Manager installation without QuickStart? 

* Cassandra (single or cluster) must be installed

* Without QuickStart, no default domain
    * See in [docs.axway.com](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/post_overview/index.html) to create host and instance
    * Or see in Topology module

* Then : 
    * Either use setup-apimanager
        * Modification of running instance
        * Modification of Cassandra
    * Modification of envSettings.props (environment configuration)

```
setup-apimanager --username admin --password changeme --adminName apiadmin --adminPass changeme -g mygroup -n myinstance --update
```

* Or use **Configure API Manager** option from Policy studio
    * Modifications done on local project
    * Needs packaging/deployment to running instance

### 4.4. Basic operations

What are basic operations here?
* Start
* Stop
* Status

What are components that are in scope of this installation?
* Admin Node Manager (ANM)
* API Gateway Instance
* Cassandra

How to achieve it? 
* Command line (for all)
* With API Gateway Manager 
    * Start/stop/status of instances with UI
    * And a UI feature means presence of an API

    ![Alt text](images/image23.png)

#### 4.4.1. Admin Node Manager (ANM)

Context
* ANM embeds API Gateway Manager
* There is one Node Manager (NM) per installation
    * And at least one NM is ANM
* ANM is able to manage instances and groups

Command line

* Executable  
`apigateway/posix/bin/nodemanager`


* Stop  
* `nodemanager -k`
```
/home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/posix/bin/nodemanager -k
```
* Start  
`nodemanager -d`
```
/home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/posix/bin/nodemanager -d
```

* Status  
`ps -eaf | grep -i "Node Manager"`  
`netstat -an | grep 8090`  
`curl -k https://localhost:8090`

#### 4.4.2. API Gateway Instance, from ANM

*Requires ANM to be started*

URL: `https://myhost:8090`
Default login: `admin/changeme`

![Alt text](images/image24.png)

API (call to ANM)

[Swagger](https://apidocs.axway.com/swagger-ui-NEW/index.html?productname=apigateway&productversion=7.7.0&filename=api-gateway-swagger.json)

#### 4.4.3. API Gateway Instance

Context

* An Instance belongs to a Group

* Names are important
    * Instance logical: `QuickStart Server`
    * Instance internal: `instance-1`
    * Group logical: `QuickStart Group`
    * Group internal: `group-2`

* Command line requires logical name


Command line

* Executable  
`apigateway/posix/bin/startinstance`

* Stop  
`startinstance -n "QuickStart Server" -g "QuickStart Group" -k`
> /home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/posix/bin/startinstance -n "QuickStart Server" -g "QuickStart Group" -k

* Start  
`startinstance -n "QuickStart Server" -g "QuickStart Group" -d`
> /home/axway/install/quickstart/apigateway/posix/bin/startinstance -n "QuickStart Server" -g "QuickStart Group" -d

* Status  
`ps -eaf | grep -i "QuickStart Server"`  
`netstat -an | grep 8080`  
`curl http://localhost:8080/healthcheck`

#### 4.4.4. Cassandra

Context
* API Manager repository
* And could be used as KPS
* Cassandra is supported by Axway as part of the solution
* See docs.axway.com here for management documentation  
[Command line](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/cass_admin/admin_cassandra_classic/cassandra_manage/index.html)


* Executable  
`cassandra/bin/cassandra`

* Start  
`cassandra -f &`  
> `/home/axway/install/quickstart/cassandra/bin/cassandra -f &`

* Stop (cf documentation)  
`kill <<pid>>`

* Status  
`netstat -an | grep 9042`  
`ps -eaf | grep -i cassandra`  

#### 4.4.5. Dependencies

Rules

* ANM and Instances can be run separately
    * No ANM implies no visibility, no deployment

* API Manager requires Cassandra
    * But instance can start without Cassandra

Recommended run order

1. Cassandra
2. ANM
3. Instances

### 4.5. Post installation steps

#### 4.5.1. Refer to docs.axway.com

[Refer to this link](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/post_overview/index.html)

*Important points*

* Link to start all tools
* Initial configuration, eg create domain
    * No need only with QuickStart
* Run as services
* Run with standard port (80, 443, ...) as non-root user
* Security guidelines


### 4.6. Installation validation

* Check Cassandra, ANM, Instances are started
    * Or start these in this order

* Connect to API Gateway Manager
    * `https://api-env.demo.axway.com:8090`
    * Default login: `admin/changeme`

* Connect to API Manager
    * `https://api-env.demo.axway.com:8075`
    * Default login: `apiadmin/changeme`

* Call healthcheck API
    * `curl http://api-env.demo.axway.com:8080/healthcheck`  


### 4.7. Containerized installation

* Installation resources publicly available from:  
[https://repository.axway.com/home](https://repository.axway.com/home)
    * Documentation

    * Helm charts (AWS, Azure, Google, Openshift, minikube,…)

* [Official documentation](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/index.html)


## 5. Conclusion

* Installation requires good preparation and always ends with validation

* Dev environment can be quickly setup with **QuickStart**

* **API Gateway** installation can be done attended with command line or UI, or unattended, very useful for automation
